#OpenAi's creation following my statement "can you create a data visualization figure using R that tracts formant values of a given csv sheet"
# This script creates a data visualization figure to track formant values from a CSV file

# Start by installing and loading the required packages
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Read the CSV file into a data frame
data = read.csv("formants.csv", header = TRUE)

# Create a line plot of the formant values
ggplot(data, aes(x = time, y = formant)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Formant Values", x = "Time (s)", y = "Formant (Hz)")
